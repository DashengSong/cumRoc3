                Three categories of cork quality, corresponding to quality_C
                    0 => Poor

    Abstract: The Cork Stoppers.xls file contains measurements performed automatically by an
    image processing system on 150 cork stoppers belonging to three classes. Each
    image was digitised with an adequate threshold in order to enhance the defects.
