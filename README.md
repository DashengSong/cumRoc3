# %cumRoc3 -- Cumulative ROC curve analysis of three-level (ternary) ordinal outcomes
**%cumRoc3** is a SASÂ® macro that implements cumulative ROC curve analysis for three-level (ternary) ordinal outcomes and comprises a two-stage semiprametric method where Stage 1 is cumulative logit regression and Stage 2 is cumulative ROC curve analysis. Analysis includes identification of cutpoints that discriminate outcome levels based on ROC curve-based criteria -- Total Accuracy, Youden Index, Matthews Correlation -- as well as calculation of parametric cutpoints from cumulative logit regression parameters.

## MANIFEST
* %cumRoc3 (in macros/cumRoc3_MAIN_MAC.sas)
	* Macro that is called directly by the user and wraps several supporting macros (in macros/)

## PREREQUISITES
* SAS 9.4 or later
	* Base SAS
	* SAS/STAT
	* SAS IML
* Three-level (ternary) ordinal outcome with levels encoded as: 0, 1, 2
* Continuous predictor variable

## ADVISORIES
* The code has been tested in SAS 9.4 TS1M3 with the two included demonstration datasets and runs with no ERRORs or WARNINGs output to the LOG.
* It is possible for ROC curve-based criteria to be tied for different values of the continuous predictor. Ties are displayed in the tabulated results.
* Preferences to facilitate interpretation
	* Numeric levels of the ternary ordinal outcome should be assigned a SAS format
	* The continuous predictor should be assigned a SAS label
* For %cr3_1Logit
	* There may be occasional convergence problems running Stage 1 cumulative logit regression with SAS 9.4 TS1M3 on Windows 10 64-bit.
	* To ensure routine convergence, MAXITER= 500 was set for Newton-Raphson optimization with ridging (SAS default).
	* As this is an arbitrary setting, consider adjusting or eliminating this setting if it does not suit your needs.
* For %cr3_2ROC
	* In SAS 9.4, OUTROC= in LOGISTIC includes the automatic variable _SOURCE_ and is used by %cr3_2ROC.
	* In versions before 9.4, this automatic variable is instead called _STEP_ and takes different values than _SOURCE_.
	* The macro's default is to refer to _SOURCE_, but to permit use in versions before 9.4 I have included commented-out code that refers to _STEP_.
