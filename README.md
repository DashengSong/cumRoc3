# %cumRoc3 -- SASÂ® macro for cumulative ROC curve analysis of three-level (ternary) ordinal outcomes
**%cumRoc3** is a SAS macro that implements cumulative ROC curve analysis for three-level (ternary) ordinal outcomes and comprises a two-stage semiprametric method where Stage 1 is cumulative logit regression and Stage 2 is cumulative ROC curve analysis. Analysis includes identification of cutpoints that discriminate outcome levels based on ROC curve-based criteria -- Total Accuracy, Youden Index, Matthews Correlation -- as well as calculation of parametric cutpoints from cumulative logit regression parameters.

## INVENTORY
* %cumRoc3
	* Macro that is called directly by the user and wraps several supporting macros
* Demonstration datasets
	* Cork Quality -- cork_SI2.CSV in data/cork
		* Description: see README_SI2.md in data/cork.

		* Usage: import CSV to SAS7BDAT by revising demoCork.sas in data\cork\ for your local circumstances then running the program.

## PREREQUISITES
* SAS 9.4 or later
* Three-level (ternary) ordinal outcome with levels encoded as: 0, 1, 2
* Continuous predictor variable

## ADVISORIES
* The code has been tested in SAS 9.4 TS1M3 with the two included demonstration datasets and runs with no ERRORs or WARNINGs output to the LOG.
* It is preferable for a SAS format to be assigned to the numeric outcome levels
* It is preferable for a SAS label to be assigned to the continuous predictor
