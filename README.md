# %cumRoc3 --- Cumulative ROC curve analysis of three-level ordinal outcomes
**%cumRoc3** is a SASÂ® macro that implements cumulative ROC curve analysis for three-level (ternary) ordinal outcomes and comprises a two-stage semiprametric method where Stage 1 is cumulative logit regression and Stage 2 is cumulative ROC curve analysis. Analysis includes identification of cutpoints that discriminate ordinal outcome levels based on ROC curve-based criteria -- Total Accuracy, Youden Index, Matthews Correlation -- as well as calculation of parametric cutpoints from cumulative logit regression parameters.
* Three operational modes may be selected for the macro
1. Complete procedure [DEFAULT]: analysis, post-processing, reporting
1. Analysis and post-processing only
1. Reporting only (prerequisite: modes 1 or 2 must have been run at least once before)

## MANIFEST
* %cumRoc3 (in macros/cumRoc3_MAIN_MAC.sas)
	* Macro that is called directly by the user and wraps several supporting macros (in macros/)
* Demonstration calls to %cumRoc3

	Downloading the repository will provide the relative directory structure necessary for running %cumRoc3 for these demonstrations. Naturally, you'll have to modify the SAS programs for these demonstrations to correctly point to your local directory, but the SAS macro program will only need the relative directory structure already in the repository.

## PREREQUISITES
* SAS 9.4 and later
	* Base SAS
	* SAS/STAT
	* SAS IML
* Three-level (ternary) ordinal outcome with levels encoded as: 0, 1, 2
* Continuous predictor variable
* User-specified directory structure for output of tabulated results and cumulative ROC curve images (see macro parameters _dir00, _dirOut, _dirPng)

## ADVISORIES
* The code has been tested in SAS 9.4 TS1M3 with the two included demonstration datasets and runs with no ERRORs or WARNINGs output to the LOG.
* It is possible for ROC curve-based criteria to be tied for different values of the continuous predictor. Ties are displayed in the tabulated results.
* Preferences to facilitate interpretation
	* Numeric levels of the ternary ordinal outcome should be assigned a SAS format
	* The continuous predictor should be assigned a SAS label
* For supporting macro %cr3_1Logit
	* There may be occasional convergence problems running Stage 1 cumulative logit regression with SAS 9.4 TS1M3 on Windows 10 64-bit.
	* To ensure routine convergence, MAXITER= 500 was set for Newton-Raphson optimization with ridging (SAS default).
	* As this is an arbitrary setting, consider adjusting or eliminating this setting if it does not suit your needs.
* For supporting macro %cr3_2ROC
	* In SAS 9.4, OUTROC= in LOGISTIC includes the automatic variable _SOURCE_ and is used by %cr3_2ROC.
	* In versions before 9.4, this automatic variable is instead called _STEP_ and takes different values than _SOURCE_.
	* The macro's default is to refer to _SOURCE_, but to permit use in versions before 9.4 I have included commented-out code that refers to _STEP_.
